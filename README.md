Full instructions on [the course website](https://sd17spring.github.io//toolboxes/web-apps/)

This toolbox exercise was developed by [Patrick Huston](https://github.com/phuston)

The code takes a list of lists that serves as the database to the website user information.

The user profiles can be accessed both through the index page and through the URL. Each user's profile page is indexed as /profile/user_number.
